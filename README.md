# MacMonitor

A lightweight, native macOS menu bar monitor — CPU thermal state, RAM, disk and battery — built without an Apple Developer account.

## Why not °C?

Most menu bar monitors call `osx-cpu-temp` (a subprocess) or access SMC directly. On macOS Ventura, **SMC access is blocked for unsigned apps** — you get `kIOReturnUnsupported` on every key, so the temperature always shows `--°`.

MacMonitor uses `ProcessInfo.thermalState` — the exact same variable macOS uses internally to decide whether to throttle your CPU. Zero SMC, zero subprocess, zero cost.

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Normal | CPU is cool, no throttling |
| Warm | Slightly warm, moderate load |
| Hot | Hot — throttling active |
| Critical | Critical — severe performance reduction |

## Features

- CPU thermal state (Normal / Warm / Hot / Critical)
- RAM usage % with active+wired+compressed calculation
- Disk usage % via `/System/Volumes/Data`
- Battery time remaining / to charge with dynamic icon
- Settings panel — show/hide each metric individually, choose language
- 9 languages: English, Português, Español, Français, Deutsch, 日本語, 한국어, 中文, हिन्दी
- Event-driven updates (thermalState via NotificationCenter, battery via IOPSNotification)
- Disk updates every 5 min, everything else every 3s
- ~0% CPU at idle, ~4 MB RAM

## Requirements

- macOS 13 Ventura or later
- Intel or Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4)
- Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`)

## Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/goiascontab-ui/macmonitor
cd macmonitor
./build.sh
open MacMonitor.app
```

First launch: right-click → Open (Gatekeeper prompt for unsigned app).
